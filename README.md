**Cinema Application by Zsolt Szilvai**

The new Star Wars movie is coming soon, so I decided to design this cinema app screen with one of the Rogue One posters. 
Also, I tried something new: notice, that the white rectangle on the bottom is bended, which makes the design a bit more lively. The app bar has a reduced opacity and the image behind it is blurred to get a unique look. 
I'd appreciate any feedback.
